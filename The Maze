Idea “The Maze”: 
This is a game plugin request. What the game is about. try to finish a maze with 15 people competing against you to see who finds
a way out. also there would be hunters. The goal of the hunters is to find the runners and kill them. when the runners respawn, 
they become hunters. runners get 20 sec headstart. after the 20 second is up, hunters spawn in to go hunt the runners. 
the game could be called maze runner. the game would last about 15 mins. when the 15 mins is up and there is a runner that survived,
the runners win. however if the hunters manage to kill all runners, the hunters win. Also if a runner finds its way out,
the runners win, plus that 

runner gets extra rewards. rewards should be editable in the config.
