Idea: “Team recruits”
I had an idea for a PvP minigame where there are four teams and an arena. It would work like this: when a player gets killed 
he rejoins the team he was killed from. for example: red team member killed by yellow team member. He would then join yellow. 
the game would continue until only one team remained alive. there would be a waiting lobby and kits players could use. 
People would get a kit by selecting them from a sign.
